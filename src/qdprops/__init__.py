"""
Ground-state properties of library quantum dots.

A standalone workflow, run over library records (`<id>/record.json` +
`start.xyz`), that relaxes each structure with MACE-MH-1 and computes
structural, vibrational and thermochemical properties, IR and Raman spectra
(MACE modes, g-xTB dipole and polarisability derivatives), stability against
bulk MA and molecular MX_q references and stepwise Z-type ligand detachment
(MACE-MH-1), and tight-binding electronic properties (GFN2-xTB).  Results go to `<id>/props/` next to the record; the webapp
ingest folds them into the library index.
